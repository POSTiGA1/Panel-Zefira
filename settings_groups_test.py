"""The settings section must stay grouped, and the grouping must not cost a control.

Two things happened here that are worth pinning.

1. The first attempt at the grouping dropped 25 controls - srv-form, pw-form,
   and every AI / Telegram / SSL field. The parse counted `<div` per LINE, so a
   card whose opening tag and whose .card-head sit on separate lines reached
   depth zero after two lines and was truncated to its header. The ids were
   never deleted; they were simply not copied. Nothing about the diff looked
   alarming until the id sets were compared.

2. The grouping adds four new i18n keys. A missing key renders as the raw key
   string on the page, so a partial translation would ship visible English
   "settings.ops" in the middle of a Persian panel. i18n_test.py checks that
   panel.html's keys exist, but nothing required them to exist in all four
   locales with the same values, so this asserts that too.

Each assertion is checked against a mutated copy of the real files, so a guard
that cannot go red is reported rather than trusted.
